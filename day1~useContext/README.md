Day 1: what is useContext? Write a react component that increments a number using the Context API.

useContext is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

"Context" : Usually, you will pass information from a parent component to a child component via props. But passing props can become verbose and inconvenient if you have to pass them through many components in the middle, or if many components in your app need the same information. Context lets the parent component make some information available to any component in the tree below it—no matter how deep—without passing it explicitly through props.
